    ####Can I use the theme purchase code to activate slider revolution?
    Theme purchase code cannot be used for slider revolution activation and slider revolution author do not allow the theme authors like me to provide the extended license purchase code for plugin as part of the theme download package.<br/><br/>
    So, if you need to update slider revolution automatically OR you need to get some support related to slider revolution then you have to purchase it separately.<br/><br/>
    I will always try to provide the latest version of slider revolution plugin with a theme update. So, I do not recommend you to purchase it separately.<br/><br/>
    Thanks.

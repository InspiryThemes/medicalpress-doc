## Configure Reading Settings
I am assuming that you have imported the XML successfully and you have home page and news page available for use. 
If this is not the case then simply create a new page using **Home Template** and name it as Home after that create another page using default template and name it as News.

To configure reading settings you need to visit **Dashboard** &raquo; **Settings** &raquo; **Reading** and choose that front page displays as static page. Then select Home as Front Page and News as Posts Page. As, displayed in screen shot below.
